## What is Helm

Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

## Install

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

## Use

## Search

```bash
helm search hub # searches the Artifact Hub, which lists helm charts from dozens of different repositories.
helm search repo # searches the repositories that you have added to your local helm client (with helm repo add). This search is done over local data, and no public network connection is needed.
```

### Install something with Helm

```bash
helm install happy-panda bitnami/wordpress
```
