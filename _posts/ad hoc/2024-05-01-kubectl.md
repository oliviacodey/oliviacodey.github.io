## Useful kubectl commands

Get current namespace

```bash
kubectl config view | grep namespace
```

Change current namespace

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace
```

Running successfully will depend on the image that you are using for `kube`. But in general terms `echo` is a built-in [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) command.

With this command:

```yaml
$ kubectl exec kube -- echo $KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST

```

You are not instantiating a Bourne Shell environment and there is not an `echo` executable in the container. It turns out what `kubectl` does is basically running `echo $KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` on your client! You can try running for example:

```yaml
$ kubectl exec kube -- echo $PWD

```

You'll see that is the home directory on your client.

Whereas with this command:

```yaml
$ kubectl exec kube -- sh -c 'echo $KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST'

```

There is a `sh` executable in your environment and that's Bourne Shell that understands the built-in `echo` command with the given Kubernetes environment in the default container of your Pod
