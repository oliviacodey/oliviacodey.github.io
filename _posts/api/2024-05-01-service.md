## What/why

Needed for exposing the pod to other pods or the entire network

## Quick Ad-hoc exposment of the pod

```bash
kubectl expose deployment/my-app --port 3306 --type LoadBalancer --name my-app-service
```

## Expost a pod the deployment way

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service # The name of the serice
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer # Only for public ip:s
  ports:
  - port: 80 # The exposed port
    targetPort: 80 # The internal port
  selector:
    app: my-app # This is what you want the service to match
```
