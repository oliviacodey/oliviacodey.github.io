## What

A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod specification or in a container image. Using a Secret means that you don't need to include confidential data in your application code.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: my-secret
type: Opaque # arbitrary user-defined data
data:
  mariadb-root-password: c2VjcmV0 # Encoded value: echo -n 'secret'|base64
```
